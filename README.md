# assembly_maze
This is a simple maze game I wrote for an assembler class a decade and a half ago. It's a bit dated and requires the Irivne32 libraries so it might take some tinkering to work. It basically uses the mazedata.txt file as an array for the maze data. Uses WASD keys to navigate. It uses colored zones for bonus points and a timer for maze completion.
